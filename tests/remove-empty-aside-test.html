		<div class="st-content" style="display: none;">
                  	
			<p>Flexible, imaginative, innovative and collaborative, industrial designers must respond to rapid commercial and technological change. Increasingly, designers are called on to take a proactive role in industry and to get involved in strategic decision-making.<br><br>This course is part of the Ceramic, Industrial and Product Design programme. MA Industrial Design students anticipate and initiate change in all areas of industrial design - in consumer-durable and capital goods, in transport, packaging and sanitary ware, in furniture for private, corporate or public environments, in architectural space, in interface design and design management, and in strategies for corporate and governmental development.<br><br>The relationships between industrial designers, manufacturers, retailers, purchasers and users are constantly being renegotiated, demanding greater flexibility and wider knowledge of industry and commerce. Against this backdrop, managerial skills are often as important as the engineering and creative skills required to develop design concepts. MA Industrial Design emphasises self-directed and peer-group learning, benefiting hugely from the range of cultures and backgrounds represented by our students.</p>
<h4>About this course</h4>
<ul>
<li>MA Industrial Design lasts 60 weeks structured as two consecutive periods of 30 weeks each (i.e. two academic years) in its 'extended full-time mode'.</li>
<li>MA Industrial Design is credit rated at 180 credits, and comprises 2 units. Unit 1 (60 credits) lasts 20 weeks. Unit 2 (120 credits) runs for 10 weeks in the first year and 30 weeks in the second year.</li>
<li>Both units must be passed in order to achieve the MA, but the classification of the award of MA derives from your mark for Unit 2 only.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected to commit 30 hours per week to your studies, within which, your taught input will normally be scheduled over three days. MA Industrial Design has been designed in this way to enable you to pursue your studies, whilst also undertaking part-time employment, internships or care responsibilities.</p>
<h4>Course outline</h4>
<p>MA Industrial Design is comprised of two Units. The first consists of a series of projects varying in length from one to six weeks. These introduce you to a variety of research methods and issues relevant to the discipline, which are then directly implemented in the creation/realisation of design work.<br><br>Unit two sees the process become less closely defined in the brief, as you are given more freedom to explore a 'theme' in the transitional project. Together, these projects form the structural and contextual basis from which you plan and then undertake your own project. You define your own research question, aims and objectives and decide on an appropriate research methodology. Through and iterative process of planning, research, design, making, testing and evaluation, your project will evolve to a point of partial or complete resolution for the final assessment.<br><br>The course postgraduate culminates in an exhibition.</p>
