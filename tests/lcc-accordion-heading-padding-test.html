			<h2>Content</h2>
<p>In a rapidly changing media environment, new technologies are changing how animation is created, experienced and understood. It is a discipline that has widely diversified and is now found everywhere.</p>
<p>Animation is creative, exploratory and playful. Students of BA (Hons) Animation will become versatile and innovative and they will understand how traditional skills underpin new digital technologies and platforms; and where and how those skills can be applied and exploited. They will also learn how to negotiate different ways of working, to collaborate, and test ideas.</p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 1em;">You can expect...</span></h4>
<p>You can expect this course to expose you to a broad and varied experience of animation work. You will negotiate a journey that begins with animation's core principles to creating work using sophisticated computer techniques and drawing on a range of techniques and disciplines including: drawing, model making, photography, film making and design.</p>
<p>You will create and develop a portfolio of work that demonstrates your creative skills and abilities, technical knowledge, and the communication and presentation skills that are necessary to succeed and flourish in a dynamic and complex media world. As creative and critical thinkers, you will be encouraged to push boundaries: to explore and experience animation in new combinations and contexts.</p>
<p>Based in the college's rich studio environment you will work on practical projects where you will understand the need to collaborate, analyse and communicate your ideas and intentions. The team-working model that is at the core of the degree will give you an understanding of the roles and functions encountered in animation production. Informed by industry and modelled on elements of industry practice these projects aim to prepare you for employment. We work with live project partners like C4, MTV, Allied Bakeries and the National Trust to deliver projects that have a profile and impact in the world outside of your course.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to develop your communication and presentation skills. Work is discussed in group crits, project presentations and industry pitches. We aim to deliver an experience that reflects and relates to the world you will encounter professionally after your degree.</p>
<p>Work-based learning both in and outside of college extends and complements your practical project work. Previously students have found placements at British Animation Awards, Disney, Foreign Office, Passion Pictures and the BBC.</p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 1em;">Learning and teaching</span></h4>
<p>Courses in UAL span a broad range of art, design, communication, business, media, science and communication subjects. So the ways in which you learn and how your time is used will vary according to the specific course you are studying; this may be in studios, labs, classes, involve working alone, learning from peers in pairs or groups, or with external partners. Most importantly, no matter which course you enrol on, you will learn not only about your subject but also about how you learn and how to increase your knowledge base.</p>
<p>Our courses will guide you to take increasing responsibility and ownership of your work and your learning. We do this so that you will be ready and able to take full advantage of the full range of opportunities offered by the creative industries in the global economy.</p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 1em;">Assessment</span></h4>
<p>Assessment always sounds austere and foreboding, but it is not. We see assessment as a very real part of learning, rather than just a means of looking back at past work and measuring achievement; we believe that assessment helps you plan future work and develop new ideas.</p>
<p>Your work will be assessed through projects or portfolios, with written papers or research journals, and, on some courses, examinations. You will be graded according to a set of marking criteria that relate to such things as research, subject knowledge, methodology, and your capacity to analyse and reflect on your achievements. So don’t be afraid of assessment - it is the way to progress.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The BA (Hons) Animation degree is an intensive studio based course where you will find yourself working collaboratively on practical projects that will expand, test and develop your knowledge and understanding of how animation is made and consumed. Your practical work will be supported and contextualised by a varied and lively series of programmes concerned with historical and theoretical studies, critical thinking, professional practice, and work based learning.</p>
<h4>Year One</h4>
<p>The first year of the degree is broad in its scope. You will be introduced to a range of HE study skills to support and develop a reflective, analytical and creative approach to your subject.</p>
<p>A detailed and exciting principles of animation unit will introduce you to the fundamentals of animation production and offer you the opportunity to experience and test different ways to create animation and moving image work.</p>
<p>Your project work will explore and test the fundamental methods and principles of the animated moving image. Working on a number of projects both individually and collaboratively you will make work that covers a range of key production areas including 2D drawn animation, character design, lip-synch and working with sound, storyboarding and sequential narrative, 3D, stop-motion, film language and design.</p>
<p>Your creative work is supported by a contextual and theoretical studies programme that will enable you to contextualise animation's history, development and role within the context of a wider moving image and visual arts culture.</p>
<h4>Year Two</h4>
<p>All Year Two students are encouraged to explore and experiment, testing the skills, knowledge and experience they have acquired in the first year of the course. You will also work with students from other design and media disciplines in the cross-college collaborative unit.</p>
<p>You will continue to work on animation production that broaden and deepen your understanding of animation, in particular its different forms, contexts and platforms. This will be achieved by live projects set by industry/cultural partners.</p>
<p>The contextual and theoretical studies programme will offer a range of subject topics for you to choose from.</p>
<h4>Year Three</h4>
<p>The final year of your course is a culmination and synthesis of the teaching and learning of the preceding two years. You will consolidate the skills, knowledge and experience you have gained with two pieces of major project work that also look forward to your progression from the course. The Year Three units will help you position yourself in terms of your strengths, interests and future career ambitions.</p>
<p>The two units that make up the year are a dissertation and collaborative major project. The collaborative major project is an opportunity to work in a specialised role, as part of a small production team, to realise a major piece of animation work.</p>

<h4>Portfolio and interview advice</h4>
<p>All application forms, personal statements and references will be read and considered. Depending on the quality of your application, you may be invited to a portfolio review where the course team will look at your work.</p>
<p>Your portfolio should include sketchbooks, research work, drawing, and finished work. A strong portfolio will document the working process and demonstrate how ideas are developed. Work will be made and explored with a variety of different materials and techniques.</p>
<p>We are interested in portfolios that evidence a contextual understanding of the subject and working process. This can be evidenced by research, visual referencing and note-making.</p>
<p>Any other work may be considered if you feel it is absolutely relevant to your application.</p>
<p>You will be given feedback on your work, a tour of the department and information about the course and its content.</p>
<p>If you are successful at the portfolio review stage you will be interviewed by the course team. Interviews will last between 15-25 minutes per person and will be with at least two members of staff. A clear indication of the success of your application will be conveyed at the end of your interview.</p>
<p>If you are successful at the interview stage you will be offered a place. Applicants are not guaranteed a portfolio review or an interview.</p>
