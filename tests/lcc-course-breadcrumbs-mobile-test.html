This can be completed from any computer once you have received notification to do so. The invitation will be sent to your University email, accessible via&nbsp;<a href="http://owa.arts.ac.uk/owa/">http://owa.arts.ac.uk/owa/</a>, so please ensure you check this account regularly.</p>

<h3><strong>Experiencing problems with Online Enrolment?</strong></h3>
<p>If you are having difficulties logging in to your Student Self Service account please use the "Contact Us" link displayed on the Student Self Service web pages. Please note our opening hours are Monday to Friday 9.00AM - 5.00PM (UK time).</p>
<p><strong>Please note this is for technical queries only</strong>. For any course related problems you will need to contact the Student administration team in your college.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Enrolment Event &ndash;new students</strong></h3>
<p>All new students must attend an Enrolment Event. This is where we verify your ID, qualifications and payment of fees.&nbsp;You will need to bring documents such as proof of identity, certificates of your qualifications and where applicable proof that you have a visa to study at UAL. However you will receive checklists from your student administration team advising you what to bring with you.</p>
<p>Please be aware that you <strong>MUST bring the originals</strong> of these documents to enrolment and also provide photocopies so that these can be kept on file.</p>
<p>You should also bring proof of payment of tuition fees or a sponsorship letter. Visit the&nbsp;<a title="Home%20%BB%20www.arts.ac.uk%20%BB%20University%20of%20the%20Arts%20London%20%BB%20Study%20At%20UAL%20%BB%20Enrol%20%BB%20Pay%20Your%20Fees%20Online" href="/study-at-ual/enrol/fee-payment/">Pay Your Fees Online</a>&nbsp;for information on paying your tuition fees via the University's secure payments facility.</p>

<h3><strong>Attendance Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>All continuing Home/EU students are required to confirm their attendance and the way you will do this depends on what type of student you are. Your student administration team will advise you when this will take place.</p>
<p>If you do not intend to return, you must inform your college as soon as possible.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Continuing Home/EU students</strong></h3>
<p>As a continuing Home/EU student you may not need to present yourself in person to complete your enrolment. Our colleges may confirm your attendance in different ways therefore please check your University email account and Moodle for further instructions.</p>
<p>It is really important that you confirm your attendance when advised. If you do not confirm your attendance we will assume you are not attending.</p>
<h3><strong>Continuing International students</strong></h3>
<p>Your enrolment is not finalised until you have presented yourself with your current passport and a visa that allows you to study at University of the Arts London.</p>
<p>If you fail to finalise your enrolment within four weeks of the start of term, we will assume you are not returning to study and will report your withdrawal to the Home Office if appropriate.</p>
<p>Please make sure you check <a title="Home%20%BB%20www.arts.ac.uk%20%BB%20University%20of%20the%20Arts%20London%20%BB%20Study%20At%20UAL%20%BB%20Learning%20%26%20Teaching%20%BB%20E-Learning%20%BB%20Moodle" href="/study-at-ual/learning-and-teaching/e-learning/moodle/">Moodle</a> for your re-enrolment slot.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>In receipt of student funding?</strong></h3>
<p>If you are expecting to receive a Student loan for your course we will confirm your enrolment to the Student Loans Company (SLC) (or equivalent) at the start of the academic year.</p>
<p>If you do not confirm your attendance when requested to do so by your college we will notify the SLC that you are not attending and your tuition fees will not be paid to the university. You may then become liable for the full fees.</p>
