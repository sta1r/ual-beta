			<p>The BA (Hons) 3D Effects for Performance and Fashion course is situated in the School of Media and Communication, and is for students who want to be designers and makers of 3D effects for performance. This includes the broad categories of theatre, film, music and television, as well as more specialised or multi-disciplinary performances, such as circus and carnival, where several elements are combined. The course integrates the intellectual demands of interpretation of the text or other written element within the performance context, with the specialised design and craft skills required for the realisation of original technical effects. The cultural and historical context of the subject is explored, to enhance the design and realisation of the practical work. Working in performance is always a collaborative venture, where the success of the production depends upon the joint efforts of a number of creative and specialised designers and makers, who work together with the director and performers. Students on this course have the advantage of being able to work with students from the related disciplines of costume and hair, make-up and prosthetics. Students have the opportunity to do a short work placement in the industry, and there are several industry-facing projects within the course. The course receives a number of requests each year for students to work with the industry on live projects, including in 2012 the Olympic Games ceremonies. Our long standing relationship with the National Theatre and other major companies provides our students with work experience. All the subject tutors teaching on the course are practitioners with extensive experience of the industry.</p>
<p>BA 3D (Hons)&nbsp;Effects for Performance and Fashion is based is based at Lime Grove in Shepherd’s Bush, just west of Holland Park and Notting Hill. The area, which is rich in cultural influences from across the world, is home to Shepherd’s Bush Market and the many fabric shops lining the Goldhawk Road. There are numerous restaurants, cafes, delis and food stores, as well as the market, which reflect the many cultures of the people living there. Nearby is the Shepherd’s Bush Empire, an excellent venue for live bands, and the Westfield Shopping Centre, one of the largest retail complexes in Europe that caters for the luxury market as well as the high street. Holland Park with its Orangery and Leighton House Museum are both worth visiting.&nbsp;</p>

  <a class="accordion-list-anchor" href=""><h3 class="size-h4">Course Units</h3><div class="st-arrow icon icon-plus-circled"></div></a>
		<div class="st-content" style="display: none;">
                  	
			<h4>Year One</h4>
<p>In the first term you will study two units.</p>
<p><strong><em>Introduction to Study in Higher Education</em></strong> gives you an understanding of your personal and professional development at university, with three core purposes: to introduce you to the necessary learning skills for undergraduate study; to show you where you are situated within the College and the University; and to help you understand what you will learn on your course and how you will develop your skills.</p>
<p><strong><em>Introduction to 3D </em></strong>introduces you to the fundamental principles and techniques required by the 3D practitioner to create 3D effects and character. You will research and explore a number of techniques and approaches, and record this in a visually appropriate and informative way. You will develop your understanding of the principles of sculpting and three dimensional approaches to realising form for the performing body. You will develop an understanding of how basic techniques can be used creatively, and will be encouraged to work in an enquiring and innovative way.</p>
<p>In the second term you will study two units.</p>
<p><strong><em>Introduction to Cultural and Historical Studies</em></strong> introduces you to key concepts and ways of thinking about fashion and its context in society and culture. You will attend lectures, seminars and workshops, and do a significant amount of reading of academic texts in order to complete a formal academic essay for assessment. Completion of this unit will allow you to make an informed choice of subject for study in the second year Cultural and Historical Studies unit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Modified Human Forms</em></strong> gives you the opportunity to work on a focussed design project. You will extend your design development process through storyboards, experimentation, drawing and 3D exploration. You will increase your understanding of a set of characters from a given narrative, and will produce a set of final designs for a chosen performance context. In workshops you will explore how the human form can be modified to create creature effects by adapting, extending and distorting the body. You will learn how to translate 2D design drawings into 3D outcomes and you will increase your technical skills such as pattern drafting and body fabrications, casting and moulding.</p>
<p>In the third term you will do the <strong><em>Consolidation and Collaboration</em></strong> unit, which allows you to demonstrate your progress through a collaborative project with students from the other performance disciplines. You will undertake research, design development and presentation as part of a group, using 2D and 3D approaches to produce a joint innovative solution to the brief, working within an agreed design aesthetic to design and realise characters from a script or text.. You will use both experimental and traditional methods, such as fibreglass mould making and the use of silicone, to realise your work in a contemporary performance context.</p>
<h4>Year Two</h4>
<p>In the first term you will be able to study a <strong><em>Cultural and Historical Studies</em></strong> unit of your choice that will broaden or deepen your learning of areas relating to your interests in your chosen field. You will have the opportunity to participate in lectures, seminars and workshops with students from other courses within your School, and will read relevant academic texts and complete a formal academic essay for assessment.</p>
<p>Also studied in the first term, the <strong><em>3D Innovation and Design</em></strong> unit introduces you to technology and its use in the creative industries to create three dimensional artefacts. You will learn about the software used to create 3D virtual objects and the output methods such as laser cutting and 3D printing. You will research, develop and design responding to a given narrative, and you will develop your awareness of research as the basis for creative design development. This unit encourages design development using digital technologies and traditional craft techniques, and you will be encouraged to adopt an enquiring approach to the development of artefacts for performance and fashion.</p>
<p>In the second term the <strong><em>Professional Development</em></strong> unit gives you the opportunity to prepare for entry into the creative industries. You will learn about CV writing and production management skills, and will begin to build your practical work into a portfolio. You will learn about the realities of the industry and your opportunities for career progression. You will develop an analytical and reflective approach to projects, which could include a work placement, simulated industry projects, live competitions, workshops or collaborative opportunities. Recent placements for students have included Millenium FX, Artem, Robert Allsopp &amp; Associates, Madame Tussauds, the National Theatre, Harry Potter, Fantastic Mr Fox and War Horse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the third term you will do two units.</p>
<p><strong><em>Research Methods for Performance </em></strong>introduces the research methods that you will employ for both your Cultural and Historical Studies Dissertation and your Final Major Project that you will undertake in the third year. You will start to consider the proposal for your dissertation, and you will learn about two key stages, the literature review and the research, how they relate to each other and how they relate in the wider context of Cultural and Historical Studies. You will look at the relationship between primary and secondary sources, ways of developing and originating research, and ways of realising the research appropriate to Cultural and Historical Studies. In parallel with this you will be starting to prepare for your Final Major Project by analysing your career direction and identifying an area of research and practice that you would like to pursue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Creative Collaboration</em></strong> unit gives you the opportunity to work with other students to design and realise characters for a narrative. Working in a small group you will together choose a context for the performance. You are encouraged to look at a new area that you have not designed for before, such as film, television, dance, theatre, opera, music video, advertising or fashion film. You are encouraged to collaborate with performers and students from other disciplines.</p>
<h4>Year Three</h4>
<p>In the first term you will do the <strong><em>Concept Development</em></strong> unit. This develops the work done in Research Methods for Performance. You will be encouraged to prepare for your Final Major Project by exploring and considering the theoretical and professional contexts of your work through in-depth research, development and experimentation. You will work to a narrative and selected performance context and will develop an appropriate methodology, paying attention to narrative, audience and production values. You will explore new ideas, processes and methods, and take risks and experiment with design and production values, working to an intended location / performance site and audience.</p>
<p>You may choose to focus on one line of enquiry, or produce a series of small test projects, or explore a range of research avenues and methods.</p>
<p>In the first and second terms you will complete a major piece of written work for the <strong><em>Cultural and Historical Studies Dissertation</em></strong> unit. This allows you to demonstrate your understanding of the critical and analytical perspectives developed within cultural and historical theory, and how you can apply these theoretical perspectives in a specific study, which you will have already identified in the third term of the second year. The dissertation gives you the opportunity to undertake primary and secondary research that examines in depth cultural issues relating to a particular aspect of fashion, lifestyle, the body, performance or the media, and to produce a written piece of work that reflects the critical debates around your chosen topic.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Final Major Project</em></strong>, undertaken in the second and third term, gives you the opportunity to produce a coherent body of original, creative and fully resolved work that will support your entry into the industry. Through your research, design development and project proposal you will produce work that demonstrates innovation, design development, the application of advanced technical skills and a high level of understanding of design for 3D effects for performance. You will be expected to manage your time effectively with reference to your written project proposal produced in the autumn term.</p>
