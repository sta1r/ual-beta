<p>London College of Communication’s BA Advertising is one of the world’s hot breeding grounds of award-winning, new talent into the advertising and communications industries.</p>
<p>This future-ready degree course will prepare you as a multi-faceted communicator, developing your own unique creative voice and forward-facing approach. A regular gatherer of awards, recently it won Gold at D&amp;AD, London; Gold at Young Lions, Cannes; Silver at Eurobest, Sweden and Silver at The One Show New York and it short lists regularly in the monthly international ad competition, Young Glory.</p>
<h4>You can expect ...</h4>
<p>You can expect to learn current advertising practices whilst also questioning latest thinking and challenging your preconceptions, so that you not only become a successful innovator today but also tomorrow. The course is structured to emulate an advertising agency where you will practice your craft and come to appreciate the conceptual, theoretical and practical aspects of advertising through to creative output and client presentation.</p>
<p>There will be a set programme of academic and live project briefs set by industry’s creative directors, and there will be opportunities to raise your profile through student competitions and self-initiated projects. In doing this you will draw on taught techniques for ideas-generation, research, consumer planning and story-boarding as well as pitching your idea for funding, and creatively realising your work to achieve strategic and brand goals.</p>
<p>Overall, you will leave the course having developed a very personal and professional approach to advertising, whereby you’ll be ready to work alone or as part of a collaborative project, creating your own future as a leader in this highly creative arena.</p>
<p>Graduates have gone on to work and gain placements in world leading advertising and communication agencies such as Anomaly London, Mother London, BBH London, BBH New York.</p>
<h4>Learning and teaching</h4>
<p>Courses in UAL span a broad range of art, design, communication, business, media, science and communication subjects. So the ways in which you learn and how your time is used will vary according to the specific course you are studying; this may be in studios, labs, classes, involve working alone, learning from peers in pairs or groups, or with external partners. Most importantly, no matter which course you enrol on, you will learn not only about your subject but also about how you learn and how to increase your knowledge base.</p>
<p>Our courses will guide you to take increasing responsibility and ownership of your work and your learning. We do this so that you will be ready and able to take full advantage of the full range of opportunities offered by the creative industries in the global economy.</p>
<h4>Assessment</h4>
<p>Assessment always sounds austere and foreboding, but it is not. We see assessment as a very real part of learning, rather than just a means of looking back at past work and measuring achievement; we believe that assessment helps you plan future work and develop new ideas.</p>
<p>Your work will be assessed through projects or portfolios, with written papers or research journals, and, on some courses, examinations. You will be graded according to a set of marking criteria that relate to such things as research, subject knowledge, methodology, and your capacity to analyse and reflect on your achievements. So don’t be afraid of assessment - it is the way to progress.</p>
<h2>Structure:</h2>
<h4><span>Year 1</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Study in Higher Education</li>
<li>Launch</li>
<li>Pitch</li>
<li>Contextual and Theoretical Studies 1</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Year 1, BA (Hons) Advertising will give you the foundation in current thinking and practice in advertising, but will also give you the tools to challenge and experiment with existing models.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to study in Higher Education:</strong> This unit will introduce you to studying at higher education level including aspects of research and writing as well as fundamental principles of design practice</p>
<p><strong>Launch:</strong> This unit aims to ‘launch your voice’ as an advertising communicator. Through a programme of team and individual study you will be given a foundation in the skills necessary to undertake research, analysis, interpretation and presentation of information as related to advertising and related communications. You will also be encouraged to experiment with ‘models’ of advertising to enable you to debate /formulate new models and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Pitch:</strong> Building on your theoretical and practical research and application of understanding of advertising and communication language in Launch, through team and individual work, you will create a pitch project presentation and develop this for final production for communication in advertising to industry.</p>
<p><strong>Contextual and Theoretical Studies 1:</strong> Contextual and Theoretical Studies (CTS) Year 1, encourages you to consider visual communication within historical and cultural contexts. Viewed as an element of design and communication CTS is explored as both a methodology and a critical context through which you can locate and develop your own approach to contemporary professional practice. The aim of CTS is to provide an underpinning in critical thinking that reinforces the relationship between studio practice and theory.</p>
<h4>Year 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative Project</li>
<li>Persuasion</li>
<li>Futurising</li>
<li>Contextual and Theoretical Studies 2</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Year 2, introduces you to the psychological and consumer behavioural aspects that underpin advertising communications, how they relate back to practice. Also, Year 2 will give you the technological tools to future proof skills. Please note year two is also an important step to enabling you to formulate ideas for your final major project (Dissertation). As mentioned before throughout the course, Theory tutors will be on hand alongside your creative tutors to help you develop your personal ideas that will eventually form your dissertation.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Project:</strong> As media converges it is necessary for Advertising Communicators to become conversant with fellow media practices. Advertising communicators can be described as being at the forefront of solvers of a communication problem, but this is only part of the communication story. Whilst different media artists and designers look at the communication story from differing angles, in order you fully understand the context of your own study, you will be given the opportunity to take place in a collaborative project with students on other courses on live projects and in competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Persuasion:</strong> Broadening your practical and theoretical understanding of advertising communication in Launch and Pitch in Year 1, Persuasion in Year 2 aims to develop a critical understanding of the consumer’s reception of advertising and will underpin the technical and creative explorations in Futurising, also in Year 2. Persuasion will give you the basic toolkit to plan creative communications based on consumer behaviour. Various theoretical perspectives will be explored ranging from the sociological, the psychological and cultural and how you as a developing planning practitioner can relate this back to creative practice.</p>
<p><strong>Futurising:</strong> Constant technological and societal changes mean as an advertising communicator you have to constantly review your practice. In order to future proof your practice and critical thinking skills this unit aims to provide you with the technical skills to become self sufficient in your practice. It will provide you with the technical skills to become a self sufficient in realising your work from concept through to the finished article. It will also critically engage you with cutting edge media and communication platforms to support you in the formulation of ideas advertising communication for the future. Skills taught in Futurising will also be linked to the Digital Portfolio unit in Year 3 which aims to consolidate skills and enable students to have a future proofed portfolio that is ready for industry. Futurising will also direct your thinking to developing a dissertation (final major project) in Year 3 based on your creative practice.</p>
<p><strong>Contextual and Theoretical Studies:</strong> The aim of this unit in Year 2 is to develop your broader knowledge and understanding of the historical, social, theoretical and cultural developments of contemporary visual culture. You will have the opportunity to further contextualise various aspects of design, media and communication theory in its broadest sense by focusing on specific options.</p>
<h4>Diploma in Professional Studies</h4>
<p class="download">The Diploma in Professional Studies is an optional Industrial placement year between the second and fourth year of the course. The Diploma in Professional Studies is a managed year of professional experience largely undertaken in the design profession in a variety of national and international locations. Students are selected during the second year on the basis of a detailed year out proposal, portfolio and studentship. Please see the <a href="/media/beta/beta-colleges/beta-lcc/courses/undergraduate/diploma-professional-studies/Diploma-Professional-Studies.01.07.13.pdf">Diploma Professional Studies Prog Spec 13.14 (PDF-64KB)</a>&nbsp;for more detail.</p>
<h4>Year 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Content Creation and Future Shaping (Self-initiated Individual Exploration)</li>
<li>Digital Portfolio</li>
<li>Contextual &amp; Theoretical Studies 3 (Dissertation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Year three develops your individual practice and consolidates learning outcomes throughout the course in the culmination and creation of a cutting edge portfolio of work and dissertation for exhibition and industry.</p>
<p><strong>Content Creation and Future Shaping:</strong> In this unit you will be supported in formulating an individual self initiated ‘blue skies’ major advertising project and working practise that plays to your strengths and individual aims and objectives as an advertising communicator.<br>You can opt to do an industrial theoretical research style project or create an evaluative creative practical project for exhibition and their portfolios, or a themed combination of both formed in agreement with tutors.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Portfolio:</strong> Building on skills attained in Futurising in Year 2, as part of your professional and personal development as an advertising communicator, your portfolio of work, theoretical or practical, needs to reflect current industry standards and be industry ready for presentation. To achieve this work created in your co unit of Content Creation and Future Shaping will be explored through a variety of digital formats. For example, you may decide to create an entirely on line digital portfolio . Alternatively, you could create a film viral or a communication app that acts as direct ‘advertisement’ of your work. Please note, the format of the digital portfolio will be decided in conjunction with your tutor.</p>

<h4>What students say ...</h4>
<p>“In our last week class in Launch we discussed ... video advertisements and how much impact they have on people. According to Sir John Hegarty: ‘A commercial is not a poster on wheels’; I believe this is completely true, as there is much more to a commercial than just animated pictures.</p>
<p>“We were introduced to some of the great examples of how commercials can express much more than just a product, famous movie ... and documentary directors Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze have done that”, Year One Student, anonymous.</p>
<p>“Our Intro to Higher Education lesson was about typography and how using fonts in various ways can create a great identity for a business or agency. This was great because it linked in with our agency work really well”, Year One student, anonymous.</p>
<p>This course is taught within the School of Media at LCC.</p>
