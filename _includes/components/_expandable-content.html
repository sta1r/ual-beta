			<p>I am a Director of a Graphic Design studio and we work for galleries, record labels and commercial clients mostly working on identities, book and exhibition design and it’s very print orientated. I found out about Short Courses at Chelsea College of Art & Design as I actually studied at UAL for my degree so I knew the College well. I decided to take the Studio Ceramics Short Course as I wanted to try out something completely new and I knew that the subject has a strong BA/MA course at Chelsea so, for me, it was the ideal place to study!</p>
			<div class="expanded-content">
				<p>Before I started the course, I wondered if I would actually come out of it with anything successful as the course was only for 8 evenings but I surprised myself with how much work could be produced in that time. I also wondered how much I would need to know of the subject before starting and whether as an amateur, the course would be suited to me – I’m happy to say it accommodated all levels and both my classmates and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
				<p>My favorite element of this course was the throwing as it turned out to be a skill I didn't know I had! I was hesitant for the first few weeks as it’s something we used to see amateurs try and humorously fail. On my first attempt, I threw a lovely small bowl. So this was something I went back to when there was a time gap in another piece I was working on.</p>
				<p>I would certainly recommend this course to someone who wanted a comprehensive overview of the processes involved in the subject. I would advise to have some ideas in advance of starting as it can help inform your experiments and encourage you to work in a more focused way.</p>
				<p>This course has inspired me and definitely added to my understanding of Ceramics. It's already fed into a design project I'm working on in the studio.</p>
				<p>My advice to anyone thinking about taking this course would be to immerse yourself in the subject. Go to shows, look at ceramicists and their work and get inspired. I started buying books half way through the course and have had friends buy me books on the subject as birthday presents since! You are led through a series of process workshops so you get to try out everything but as it’s a Short Course its good to have a goal in mind.</p>
