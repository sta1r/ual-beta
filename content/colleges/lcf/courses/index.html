    					If you want to study at London College of Fashion but find it hard to commit to a full time course, then you could think about studying flexibly. We have carefully developed undergraduate and postgraduate courses to meet the challenges of the fashion industry.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					Our part-time courses will develop a sound knowledge of the chosen subject combined with a realistic and practical understanding of the demands of a specialist industry sector. There are few opportunities nationally to study fashion on a part-time basis, and these courses respond to the needs of a variety of students who are unable to engage in full-time study or who prefer to study part-time.
